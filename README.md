*Overview of HeartVolMesh. A covariance-guided image-to-surface module predicts the target boundary, and a template-driven volume-to-surface registration stage converts it into a patient-specific tetrahedral mesh.*

## Overview

HeartVolMesh is a project for reconstructing patient-specific **tetrahedral cardiac meshes** directly from **3D CTA volumes**. The method is designed for simulation-oriented applications such as cardiac digital twins and in-silico studies, where a surface mesh alone is not sufficient.

Compared with conventional segmentation-then-meshing pipelines, HeartVolMesh aims to:

- preserve thin-wall anatomical details and multi-structure junctions,
- maintain topology consistency during reconstruction,
- generate volumetric meshes with cross-case correspondence,
- support downstream FEM/CFD-style simulation workflows.

## Key contributions

1. **Covariance-guided graph deformation**  
   Each template vertex is lifted from a deterministic point to an anisotropic Gaussian representation, enabling direction-aware geometric modelling instead of relying only on uniform Euclidean supervision.

2. **Template-driven volumetric meshing**  
   A high-quality tetrahedral template is aligned to the predicted surface and deformed through a dense deformation field, preserving connectivity and enabling cross-case correspondence.

3. **Whole-heart validation**  
   The framework is evaluated in multi-structure cardiac reconstruction and shows consistent gains in both surface-mesh accuracy and volumetric boundary fidelity, together with strong element quality.

## Method

![Representation](assets/heartvolmesh/representation.png)

*HeartVolMesh extends a standard mesh representation to ` [x, y, z] + 6 covariance parameters `, allowing local anisotropy to be learned directly from volumetric images.*

The pipeline contains three main stages:

1. **Image-conditioned vertex features**  
   A 3D CNN extracts multi-scale volumetric features, which are sampled at current vertex positions and propagated over the mesh graph with a GNN.

2. **Coarse-to-fine surface prediction**  
   The mesh is progressively refined across stages. The final head predicts both vertex displacements and covariance parameters for covariance-guided surface reconstruction.

3. **Surface-to-volume propagation**  
   Surface motion is converted into a dense deformation field and applied to every vertex of a tetrahedral template, yielding a volumetric mesh whose boundary matches the reconstructed patient-specific surface.

## Experimental setting

- **Dataset:** multi-centre in-house dataset with **900 patients** and **4,000 temporal instances**
- **Split:** **800 patients / 3,600 instances** for training and **100 patients / 400 instances** for validation
- **Training:** single **NVIDIA A100 80GB** GPU, Adam optimizer, 100 epochs, batch size 1
- **Input crop:** `128^3`
- **Deformation field resolution:** `300^3`

### Best volumetric-boundary results (Ours 3p6)

## Key takeaways

- **Better boundary localization:** covariance-guided supervision improves robustness in ambiguous and thin anatomical regions.
- **Volumetric meshes with correspondence:** deforming a fixed tetrahedral template preserves connectivity and enables cross-case vertex correspondence by design.
- **Simulation-oriented flexibility:** the template-conditioned formulation can support different mesh densities and element specifications when an appropriate template is provided.
